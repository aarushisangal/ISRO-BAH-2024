# Detailed Approach & Implementation
# Wehave opted for PROBLEM STATEMENT-3: Automatic detection of craters & boulders from Orbiter High Resolution Camera(OHRC) images using AI/ML techniques.
# ● APPROACH: The goal of our algorithm is to automatically detect craters and boulders on the lunar surfaces. For this, we have developed a two-staged system- consisting of Inception-v3 for image classification and Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation which were both fine-tuned to the boulder and crater detection task. We first trained the inception model to detect whether the given image have any boulders or craters in it. If it have, then the image is passed on to the Mask R-CNN model which performs image segmentation. It segments the boulders or craters in different color than the rest of the image. Then this image, along with the information of the boulders or craters’ coordinates in the image are stored in a csv/xlsx file which both are given as output.
# ● IMPLEMENTATION: Toimplement this system, we have developed a website on which you will upload the data in the form of video/photo/folder of photos which is processed and then the output is given in the form of a zip file containing the segmented image/video as well as the information of each in a csv file.
